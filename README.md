# lend-borrow
sample lend and borrow smart contract 
This  Sample is a Solana-based smart contract for a lending protocol, implementing core functionalities like deposits, borrowing, repayments, withdrawals, and liquidation with collateralization. It ensures that users can borrow funds only when their collateral meets the required collateral ratio, and provides a liquidation process for over-leveraged accounts.
This smart contract implements a basic lending system on the Solana blockchain, allowing users to deposit funds, borrow funds against collateral, repay loans, withdraw deposits, and liquidate accounts in case of over-leverage.

Key features:

Deposit: Increases the user's deposits.
Borrow: Allows the user to borrow funds against their collateral, ensuring the collateralization ratio is maintained.
Repay: Lets the user repay a portion of their loan.
Withdraw: Allows users to withdraw funds from their deposits while ensuring they still meet the collateralization requirements.
Liquidate: Liquidates a user's account if the borrowed amount exceeds a predefined liquidation threshold.


Smart Contract Components
The project consists of the following key components:

entrypoint.rs: The entry point of the Solana smart contract, handling incoming instructions and routing them to the correct processing function (deposit, borrow, repay, etc.).

lib.rs: The core logic of the contract, including functions like deposit, borrow, repay, withdraw, and liquidate.

processor.rs: Contains the business logic for each individual instruction, delegating calls to the functions in lib.rs.

state.rs: Defines the data structures (like UserAccount) to store the state of the contract, such as user balances, deposits, and loans.

utils.rs: Contains helper functions, such as checking collateralization ratios or performing other utility tasks across multiple files.

instructions.rs: Manages the serialization and deserialization of instructions sent to the smart contract, ensuring that instructions are processed correctly.

error.rs: Defines custom error codes for specific contract errors, allowing better error handling and reporting.
